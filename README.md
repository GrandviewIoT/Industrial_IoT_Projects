Work in progress.

More nhancements, bug fixes, and documentation coming soon.
Associated TI CCS and IAR / SystemWorkbench project files to build these will also be uploaded shortly.

Suite of code projects to demonstrate MCU based industrial IoT WiFi/BLE/LoRa sensor based designs,
including working with factory PLCs (AB/Siemens) using MODBUS. 

MCUs include ST STM32, and TI Tiva 123G and 129, plus TI MSP432/MSP430 initially.
Will later be adding FPGA based Cypress PSoC 4 and Microsemi SmartFusion 2 designs.
